### Problem 6: Data Plotting

Now, you'll use your simulation to answer some questions about the robots' performance.

In order to do this problem, you will be using a Python tool called PyLab.

Below is an example of a plot. This plot does not use the same axes that your plots will use; it merely serves as an example of the types of images that the PyLab package produces.

**Note to those who did the optional visualization:** For problem 6, we make calls to `runSimulation()` to get simulation data and plot it. However, you don't want the visualization getting in the way. If you chose to do the visualization exercise, before you get started on problem 6 (and before you submit your code in submission boxes), **make sure to comment the visualization code out of `runSimulation()`**. There should be 3 lines to comment out. If you do not comment these lines, your code will take a REALLY long time to run!!

**For the questions below, call the given function with the proper arguments to generate a plot using PyLab.**

#### Problem 6-1
3/3 points (graded)

Examine <code>showPlot1</code> in <code>ps2.py</code>, which takes in the parameters _title_, _x_label_, and _y_label_. Your job is to examine the code and figure out what the plot produced by the function tells you. Try calling <code>showPlot1</code> with appropriate arguments to produce a few plots. Then, answer the following 3 questions.

1. Which of the following would be the best title for the graph?

    Time It Takes 1 - 10 Robots To Clean 80% Of A Room correct

2. Which of the following would be the best x-axis label for the graph?

    Number of Robots correct

3. Which of the following would be the best y-axis label for the graph?

    Time-steps correct
